This folder contains the files of the corrected pairs.
The file AeBBnA.xlsx contains the 1513 single-side entailment pairs, which were re-annotated and when needed corrected. You can find the corrected label and a comment for the correction in the file.
The file oneWordDifference.xlsx contains three different sheet: the 1st sheet contains all one-word difference pairs, the 2nd one contains only the pairs which did not get an automatic label from PWN and the 3rd sheet contains only those pairs that got a label from PWN. In this third sheet you can also find the corrections that were made to those pairs.
The file SICK_partly_corrected.txt is the otherwise original SICK corpus except for the 1513 single-side entailments and the 1641 PWN labeled entailments for which we deliver the corrected versions.
